Oh, hey there - fellow geek!

Thought you'd come back stage and see how this puppy runs, huh? 
Well I hate to disapoint, but it doesn't get much simpler than this. 
There's no magic, no server-side processing or Javascript wizardry.
Just plain old HTML with a little bit of CSS. Not even the fancy Sass kind, either.

Because I'm a big advocate of less is more. I'm not going to host this on a powerful
load-balanced server running the might of .NET 4.5 to do nothing more than serve up
24 words and 26 lines of HTML. That would be a waste of my time, be difficult to 
maintain and would end up costing more. That doesn't sound like fun, so here we are.

But thanks anyway for stopping by. Nice to know my indentation is appreciated every
once in a while. You know what? You should totally @reply me with some sort of 
secret hashtag, so that I know you were here and you know you're part of an super
secret (and awesome) club.

What's the hashtag?

Ah. Now that would be telling.
